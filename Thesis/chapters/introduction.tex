%% Anomaly Detectioni anlat abstracten acip
Anomaly detection is an increasingly popular field in computer vision and is a challenging 
problem concerning wide variety of application domains such as cyber security, healthcare, 
finance and Internet of Things (IoT) \cite{Chandola:2009:ADS:1541880.1541882}. As the methods of obtaining and 
utilizing potential use cases for data grows, quality, maintenance and the performance of 
the systems we benefit become more dependent on the provided data. Considering these systems 
rely on the quality and the accuracy of data, anomaly detection plays a crucial role to preserve the 
significance of data itself. Anomalies can be defined as the samples that don't follow the 
characteristic behaviors of the defined notion of normality for that data \cite{Chandola07anomalydetection:}. 
Main importance of anomaly detection comes from the fact that abnormalities in the data 
may often be translated to critical and  actionable information.

One of the main problems of solving anomaly detection tasks is to obtain data. 
Depending on the domain, anomaly might be a very rare occurrence or it might be costly for the 
system to replicate the conditions of the anomalous case. Reconstruction based methods for anomaly 
detection focus on computing the representation for normal portion data, and uses this representation 
to differentiate the normal and anomalous samples. This method is used when there is an imbalance between normal 
and anomalous data sample size in the dataset. Main premise is that classifying data sample with higher dimensional 
feature space such as images, as anomalous or normal, becomes easier if the underlying data of interest 
lies in a subspace of lower dimensionality than its original form \cite{Beyer:1999:NNM:645503.656271}. 
Hence we can model the data in a lower dimensional complexity and find an appropriate way to reconstruct 
to its original higher-dimensional representation. Obtaining an approximation of the normal data using 
this reconstruction does not give the same type of result when computed with an anomalous sample. 
Autoencoder networks (see Section \ref{sec:ae}) are heavily used for reconstruction based anomaly 
detection tasks. They consist of an encoder and decoder network. Encoder 
network is trained to learn the latent representation and decoder network is trained to obtain 
the reconstruction to model the normality of data with no anomalies. Over the years, different 
variants of autoencoder networks are employed for anomaly detection 
\cite{kingma2013autoencoding, Masci2011StackedCA, an2015variational, leveau2017adversarial, Pidhorskyi:2018:GPN:3327757.3327787}.

This thesis investigates the performance of anomaly detection methods that utilizes generative adversarial 
networks (GAN) (see Section \ref{sec:gan}) to solve defect detection problem of SEM image dataset \cite{sem} 
(see Section \ref{sec:sem}). Later on a model is proposed which consist of an energy based generative adversarial 
network and two encoder networks. Primary encoder network is trained adversarially with generator network to 
learn bidirectional mapping between the image space and latent dimension space. Secondary encoder network 
is trained to learn the latent representation of the reconstructed image samples obtained from the generator 
network. Comparative analysis between anomaly detection methods that uses generative adversarial networks and 
the proposed model regarding reconstruction quality of the generator network and overall performance is carried 
out via an ablation study and a series of incremental experiments.

Results of the experiments showed that training methodology obtained for the proposed model improved 
both the performance of generator network and encoder networks. It is also observed that anomaly detection 
performance of the model can be improved by utilizing an anomaly detection score based on the latent representations 
of the query image and its reconstructions rather than the images itself.


This document is organized as follows: Chapter \ref{chap:sota} presents the anomaly detection 
problem throughly, introduces the network models that are used for constructing anomaly 
detection methods such as generative adversarial networks and autoencoder networks and 
explains the state of the art anomaly detection methods that utilizes generative adversarial networks. 
Chapter \ref{chap:latdel} introduces some of the latest developments concerning 
generative adversarial networks and anomaly detection task. Chapter \ref{chap:arim} analyzes the problems 
other GAN based anomaly detection models face with SEM image dataset and presents our proposed model. 
Experimental results are described in Chapter \ref{chap:expres} and the conclusion and 
the future work is stated in chapter \ref{chap:conc}.
