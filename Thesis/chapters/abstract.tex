Anomaly detection is an increasingly popular field in computer vision and is a challenging 
problem concerning various application domains. As the methods of gathering and utilizing 
data grows, quality and the performance of the systems we benefit become
more dependent on the data they use. Considering these systems rely on the quality of data, anomaly detection 
plays a crucial role to detect abnormalities that may harm the system if left undiscovered. In scenarios where 
the abnormal data is a rare occurrence or simply costly to be observed, reconstruction based approaches 
are used to model the normal data to learn to differentiate anomalies when encountered. Generative adversarial 
networks is relatively new method that is used to generate new and unobserved data in an unsupervised way and 
its adoption to reconstruction based anomaly detection framework is promising.

This thesis provides a model to predict the anomalous regions on the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images 
of nanofibrous materials using a framework based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) and encoder networks. 
Proposed solution learns the bidirectional mapping between the image and its latent dimension space using the adversarial 
training of the generator network and the encoder network. 

We show that our approach produces better results than other GAN based anomaly detection frameworks trained with our 
dataset. While the performance increase is a small margin, our method shows better visual reconstructions of the data.
