First I would like to thank to my advisor Giacomo Boracchi, for giving me an opportunity to work on this 
project and for his supervision. His continuous guidance and the effort he put into his feedbacks helped me create 
something I am proud of. I also want to thank to my co-supervisor Diego Carrera for his feedback.

I also want to express my deepest gratitude to my fianc\'e for accompanying me during this long journey. 
I will always appreciate how understanding and patient she was with me even when I'm most stressed.
Her perpetual support and positivity helped me get through the most arduous times in these 2 years. 

Finally, I thank my family for always being supportive of me and my goals. I thank my father for always 
inspiring me to keep working to pursue my interest, my mother who supported me unconditionally and helped me to 
become who I am today, and my brother who I love dearly. I could not achieve this without them.
